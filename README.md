## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


### Links

- [Github](https://github.com/chivicks-hazard/frontendmentor-testimonial-grid-section)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learnt how to use grid box to create a responsive layout. It also made me to understand how some websites use grid boxes to define the layout of major components of the website while using flexbox for the inner parts of the elements in the layout.

### Continued development

With this, I will be trying to use the grid box more often to build websites.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The TailwindCSS documentation will be very helpful for those using it in their projects.
